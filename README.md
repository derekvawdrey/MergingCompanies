# MergingCompanies

This repository is an implementation of the given scenario below.

## Take-home assignment
The scenario is you have two companies in a database (one is a duplicate of the other, entered erroneously by an employee). Provide an HTTP interface to merge these two companies together. Include in your solution a way for users to resolve conflicts when datapoints differ between the two companies. Ensure your solution also handles the updating of Users and Brances so that they are associated with the correct, resulting company from the merge.

- How would you do it?
- How would you architect the HTTP interface for that?
- How many endpoints?
- Message Structures?
